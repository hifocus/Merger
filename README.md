> Merge your qrcode quicker.   
> [Demo](https://demo.qrcdn.com) | [中文文档](https://github.com/hifocus/merger/blob/master/README_CN.md) | [博客文章](https://tech.hxco.de/solutions/merger.html)

## Why

There are more than three different mobile payment methods with all different receipt qrcodes. So the problem is, you might get it wrong while you are super busy. Why don't we merge them into one with fantastic styles that everyone would love'in it. And...additionally, being a bit more international? 

 ## Screenshots

## Downloads

## Notices

### Bugs Notice

During the development of this project, bugs might appear and affect your site. Here are two suggestions:
1. Make sure your `Merger` version is at **stable**. To do this, download the latest release which is not `pre-release`. Stable version of `Merger` often contains latest security update and bug fixes. Stick with them to make sure nothing goes wrong.
2. Check out frequently, or subscribe to our [Bugs Notice Board](https://github.com/hifocus/merger/issues/2). All knwon bugs will appear over there and their status will also be updated.

### ICP Notice for China

In some Chinese app, especially for WeChat, the internal browser will display a security remind page for those domains that have no ICP record in China. Obviously, this is not friendly to users and they might doubt the safety of your site. Here are two solutions:

1. Use **ICP recorded domain**, like our demo site: [https://demo.qrcdn.com](https://demo.qrcdn.com)
2. Use **GitHub Pages subdomain**. GitHub's domain was marked as green in QQ and WeChat by somehow without having ICP records. So Use GitHub Pages to build your own `Merger` but do not use a custom domain. Use the default `username.github.io` subdomain. Please try out this one: [https://hifocus.github.io/Merger_Demo/merger.html](https://hifocus.github.io/Merger_Demo/merger.html) to see how it works in WeChat.

## Configuration

We made the configuration much more easier.

### Head Section

You will need to configure the `head` tag of the `merger.html` first.

```
     <title>Merger Demo - merge your qrcode quicker</title>
```
The `title` tag will decide what to display in browser's tab. Edit it to something like "Pay to David" to make more sense to users.

```
     <meta name="Keywords" content="Merger,open source,hxco,hifocus,merge qrcode,qrcode" />
     <meta name="Description" content="Merger is the most simple way to merge your qrcode together." />     
```
There are `meta` tags with SEO information included in the `head` section. Please remove them if you don't want the search engine to list your site in its results.

```
     <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/0072Lfvtly1fyegd14voyj30dw0dwt9x.jpg">
```
Here comes with the icon part. Replace the image link with yours to get your own icon in browser's tab. Not sure where to host your icon? Try [imgur](https://imgur.com) or [SM.MS](https://sm.ms) out!

You are more then welcome to edit other parts of the `head` tag if you know what to do, expect the `<meta name="author" content="Huangxin, LF112" />` bit. You can only remove them if you really don't want them to appear while copyright reservation is require if you decide to use this project.

### Main Config Section

Right under the `<body>` tag that you can see underneath the `<head>` section, there is the `Config part`. Configure everything you need here. and no where else.

There are detailed code comments in the `Config part`. Basically, everything is this format:

```
var something = "something actual";
```

Please be careful about the part after the `=`. Don't forget to quote your own information (like your wechat pay link) with the double quotes `""` and add a semicolon `;` at the end.

You will have to fill in your payment links, from WeChat Pay, Alipay, Tenpay(from Mobile QQ) and Paypal. For Wechat Pay, Alipay and Tenpay, you can get your actual link by decoding your payment qrcode. For Paypal, simply create your own [paypal.me](https://paypal.me) link and put it in.

Then you fill in your preferred name and profile photo link (at least 200x200 px). Other variable guide please follow the code comment.

## How to Deploy
`Merger` is a html template so anywhere can run static website would be fine. If you don't have your own `Shared Hosting Service` or `Virtual Private Server`, use service like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Simply upload everything involved to your service and serve it from your domain. If you don't have a domain, get one for free from [Freenom](https://freenom.com) or buy one.

## Principle

`Merger` detacts user's `UserAgent` and sort them into different categories. Every sinle category will have different presentation of the site.

If the user opens the site from desktop end (like a PC browser), he will get the desktop view of the site. In this case, he gets to choose a way to pay you. For wechat pay, alipay and tenpay, he will get the direct qrcode instantly (which are generated by JQuery qrcode plugin). He scans it, you can paid. Simple.

If the user opens the site from mobile end, and in a mobile browser (like Chrome for Android), he will still get the option to choose payment method and pay you. The style will be adjusted slightly.

If the users open the site from mobile end, and in those specifc app (wechat pay, alipay, etc.) he will be shown with the direct qrcode. He will need to keep pressing the qrcode until the menu pops out and show the option to `Identify the qrcode`. Then you get paid.

For Mobile QQ only, the internal browser does not support the identify of qrcode that is in `data:image` type (default type), so `Merger` will import the qrcode from the qrcode API, which is configurable in the `Config Part`.

For Alipay only, user will be redirect to the payment link directly. No need for second-time scaning.
